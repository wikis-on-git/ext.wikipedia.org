Las '''Islas Pitcairn''' (''Pitkern Ailen'' ena luenga pitkern/norfuk) son un archipielagu que holma parti la Polinésia, en Oceanía. Solu una la cincu islas que la componin está abitá, la isla Pitcairn. Es la úrtima colónia ingresa que quea nel Pacíficu, i es coñocía polque la su puebración es descendienti los amotináus del Bounty i las sus muheris taitianas. Los sus 46 abitantis (pretenecientis a 9 famílias) hazin desti país nu soberanu el menus puebrau el mundu (inque nu es una nación soberana).

Enas islas Pitcairn y Henderson, ubu una puebración d'orihin polinesiu alreol el añu 800, sostribás pol comercio cola isla Mangareva, ena atual Polinésia Francesa. Quandu esti comercio s'acabihó (pol una catástrofi ambiental), las puebracionis umanas nu tiinian los recursus nesezárius pala su sobreviváncia i esaparecierun.

== Estória ==
Pitcairn hue redescubierta en 1767, Ducie en 1791, Henderson en 1819 i Oeno en 1824.

Las islas son coñocidas ebiu a que los amotinaus del Bounty s'asentarun nesta isla, huendu los sus primeros abitantis en sigrus. Estu passó en 1790 i los descendientis destus amotinaus entavia abitan nella.

Pitcairn se convirtió en coloña británica en 1838, i en 1850 la isla queó completamenti desabitá quandu la puebración se gorvió mu grandi para sostribalsi i se muarun a la Isla Norfolk. 18 meses endispués, 17 abitantis regresarun a Pitcairn pa repobrala. Endi esse momentu la puebración á arcançau un picu e 223, peru dau que la huerça la henti emigra a Nueva Celanda, normalmenti abitan la isla unus 50 habitantis.

En 1838 las islas hueron el primel territóriu el mundu ondi s'aprebó el sufrahiu femeninu, colas mesmas caraiterísticas qu'el sufrahiu masculinu.
