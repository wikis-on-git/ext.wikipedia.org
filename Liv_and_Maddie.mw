==Plot==
Actress Liv Rooney ([[Dove Cameron]]) has just come home to [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=Skate-A-Rooney|episodelink=|series=Liv and Maddie|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=October 13, 2013|season=1|number=6|minutes=00:36}}</ref> after a four-year stint in Hollywood filming a popular television program called ''Sing It Loud!'', which has just finished its run, to the open arms of her parents, brothers, and twin sister, Maddie (also played by Cameron). The pair had hoped to resume their relationship from before Liv left, but instead have grown into opposing personalities with different interests. Liv has become very girly and enjoys any time someone mentions her former career, whereas Maddie has become a tomboy perfecting her basketball skills and is the captain of her basketball team. They have two brothers: Joey ([[Joey Bragg]]), the typical awkward teen, and Parker (Tenzing Norgay Trainor), a confident and clever child. Rounding out the Rooney clan is their mother Karen ([[Kali Rocha]]), the school psychologist (later vice principal), and their father Pete ([[Benjamin King (actor)|Benjamin King]]), Maddie's basketball coach, both of whom are anxious to now care for all their children under one roof. Some events take place at Ridgewood High, the high school where the three elder Rooney children attend and both parents work.

A significant feature has a cutaway where specific characters break the [[fourth wall]] to tell the viewers about different things.
